# cex-stock-checker
Checks stock at CeX and gives alert if there is stock.

It is recommended to be run somewhat frequently in order to be updates on stock status.

I got the original idea from: https://github.com/SplinterHead/CEX-Stock-Check

## Modify the config.json
Modify the config.json.example and rename to config.json

Change the list of CeX skus as needed, if last one don't add another comma to the line end

Set the stocks to all be "no" follow same comma procedure.

Example config checks for Nintendo Switch and a 3DS XL
